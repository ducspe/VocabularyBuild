# VocabularyBuild side project for augmenting train data

### The program takes all words from file "inputwords" and creates a file "outputdictionary" with synonyms, hyponyms and hypernyms. The order is not preserved between the files because a HashMap and Set datastructures are used to do the computations... Input file has format: one word per line. Output file has same format. An extra method can be added to take the output file and convert it to a desired format...
